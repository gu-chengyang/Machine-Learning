# Machine-Learning
This repository contains my personal machine learning explorations and studies.

For large datasets that are over 100mb and cannot be uploaded to Github directly, I will upload their compressed formats for references.

In general, I categorise my machine learning projects into two major categories:
- Regression
- Classification

Folders with corresponding names indicate what kind of machine learning task the projects inside the folders focus on.
